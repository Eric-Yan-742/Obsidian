# Run sql script in DataGrip

- Target data souce / schema means which database you want to connect to

# Connect Tomcat to MySQL

![[_attachments/Untitled 96 2.png|Untitled 96 2.png]]

1. Download JDBC Driver .jar file
2. Place the JAR file in your app’s WEB-INF/lib directory
3. Create a new user for server to login
    
    ```SQL
    CREATE USER 'webECommerce'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'webECommerce';
    
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'webECommerce'@'localhost';
    
    #
    # Starting with MySQL 8.0.4, the MySQL team changed the 
    # default authentication plugin for MySQL server 
    # from mysql_native_password to caching_sha2_password.
    #
    # The command below will make the appropriate updates for your user account.
    #
    # See the MySQL Reference Manual for details: 
    # https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.html
    #
    ALTER USER 'webECommerce'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'webECommerce';
    ```
    
4. Define connection pool
    1. webapp/META-INF/context.xml
        
        ```HTML
        <Context>
        <!-- name is an alias, not actual directory -->
        
        <!-- User we just created -->
          <Resource name="jdbc/web_student_tracker" 
          			auth="Container" type="javax.sql.DataSource"
                       maxActive="20" maxIdle="5" maxWait="10000"
                       username="webstudent" password="webstudent" 
                       driverClassName="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"
                       url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/web_student_tracker?useSSL=false&amp;serverTimezone=UTC"/>
        </Context>
        ```
        
    2. Tells Tomcat how to configure your pool.
    3. DataSource = Connection pool
5. Get connection pool in Java code
    
    ```Java
    @WebServlet(name = "TestServlet", value = "/TestServlet")
    public class TestServlet extends HttpServlet {
        @Resource(name="jdbc/web_student_tracker")
        private DataSource dataSource;
        @Override
        protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
            // 1. Set up the printwriter
            PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
            response.setContentType("text/plain");
            // 2. get a connection to the database
            Connection myConn = null;
            Statement myStmt = null;
            ResultSet myRs = null;
            try {
                myConn = dataSource.getConnection();
                // 3. Create a SQL statements
                String sql = "select * from student";
                myStmt = myConn.createStatement();
                // 4. Execute SQL query
                myRs = myStmt.executeQuery(sql);
                // 5. Process the result set
                while(myRs.next()) {
                    String email = myRs.getString("email");
                    out.println(email);
                }
            }
            catch (Exception exc) {
                exc.printStackTrace();
            }
    
        }
    }
    ```

## List Student

- Student DB Utility
    - Reponsible for interfacing with the database using JDBC code
    - This is a common design pattern: **Data Accessor Object (DAO)**
- `init()` method in Servlet: It is called by the Java EE server or by Tomcat when this servlet is first loaded or initialized.
    - Does all initialization work for the servlet, just like the constructor of a servlet
    - The `**init()**` method of a Servlet is typically executed only once during the Servlet's lifecycle, specifically when the Servlet is first loaded by the server or when the Servlet container starts up. It is not called every time the Servlet is invoked or when it processes individual client requests.
- Use css in a jsp page
    - create a css folder under webapp
    - Suppose css file is called style.css, add `<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">` under the head of the .jsp file.
- Web App Welcome Files
    
    - Defines a list of “welcome files”
    - In web.xml
        
        ```XML
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <web-app xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee"
                 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                 xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_4_0.xsd"
                 version="4.0">
            <welcome-file-list>
                <welcome-file>StudentControllerServlet</welcome-file>
            </welcome-file-list>
        </web-app>
        ```
        
        - web.xml will find `StudentControllerServlet` in the root directory of your web app. Don’t add / at the beginning (no absolute path)
    
    ## Add Students

    - Redirect from one jsp page to another jsp page
        
        ```HTML
        <!-- put new button: Add Student, class is CSS style -->
        <input type="button" value="Add Student"
            onclick="window.location.href='add-student-form.jsp'; return false"
            class="add-student-button"
        />
        ```
        
        `**onclick="window.location.href='add-student-form.jsp'; return false"**`: This is the `**onclick**` attribute, which defines JavaScript code to execute when the button is clicked.
        
        - `**window.location.href**` is a JavaScript property that represents the current URL of the browser window.
        - `**'add-student-form.jsp'**` is a string containing the URL to which the browser will navigate when the button is clicked. In this case, it's set to `**'add-student-form.jsp'**`, which is presumably the URL of a JSP (JavaServer Pages) file.
        - `**return false**` is used to prevent the default behavior of the button, which is to submit a form (if it's placed within a form element) or follow a link. By returning `**false**`, you're telling the browser not to perform the default action.
