Introduction: Hi I'm Eric. Now I'm a third year student studying in UC San Diego. I major in CS and math. I have course work in data structure, algorithm design, operating system, and a bunch of math classes. I did an internship at Xiaomi last year. I used Java with its web framework Springboot and MySQL. 

Internship at Xiaomi: 
- What did you do? The financial staff will upload many sales performance reports in excel sheets. They contain each employer's name, their sales revenue in the past month, and their positions etc. I need to download and parse the excel spreasheets. Sotre the information into data base. Reorganize the data for reviewing and calculate the incentive bonuses for each employers. It helps them improve the speed of reviewing and calculating the bills. 
- Switch data source: Accessing data souce is a big part of back end program. You may add, update, delete, search different data with different constraint. Sometimes you may expect to use different data bases in the future, their data access procedure and query langauge are different. The dependency injection feature is pretty handy for that. I can create a data manipulation interface and implement it with different data souce. In the upper level of the program, I can inject the interface and manipulate the data however I want. The Spring framework will decide which implementation to use with a few lines of annotations. To switch the data souce, you just need to edit the annotation a bit instead of changing the source code of the upper level of the program.  
- Front end and backend manipulation.
