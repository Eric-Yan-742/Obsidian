Introduction: Hi I'm Eric. Now I'm a third year student studying in UC San Diego. I major in CS and math. I have course work in data structure, algorithm design, operating system, and a bunch of math classes. I did an internship at Xiaomi last year. I used Java with its web framework Springboot and MySQL. 

Internship at Xiaomi: 
- What did you do? The financial staff will upload many sales performance reports in excel sheets. They contain each employer's name, their sales revenue in the past month, and their positions etc. I need to download and parse the excel spreasheets. Sotre the information into data base. Reorganize the data for reviewing and calculate the incentive bonuses for each employers. It helps them improve the speed of reviewing and calculating the bills. 
- Switch data source: In Spring, you can create a Java interface for data manipulation. You may add, update, delete, search different data with different constraint.
