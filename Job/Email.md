## Recruiter's Email

Here's a list of recruiter emails. You can email recruiters directly instead of applying online, this gives a higher chance that they will respond to your application. I also attached a screenshot of what I emailed recruiters when I was applying in college (you can try sending something like this)

Title:

U Chicago Student Interested in Technical Opportunities at `[Company Name]`

  

Hi `[First Name]`,

  

I'm a 4th year undergraduate at the University of Chicago, studying Computer Science and Statistics. I interned as a software engineer at PayPal last summer, working on applications to analyze and process complaints.

  

I'm graduating this June, and I'm currently looking for full time positions. If you're available over the phone for a quick chat about potential opportunities at `[Company Name]`, I'd greatly appreciate it. 

  

  

Best,

Kevin
