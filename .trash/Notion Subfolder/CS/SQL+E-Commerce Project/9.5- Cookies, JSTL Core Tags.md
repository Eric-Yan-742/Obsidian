# Cookies

- Pupose of a cookie: Personalize a website for a user
- A cookie is a text data exchanged between web browser and server
- Name / value pair
- Browser will only send cookies that match the server’s domain name.
- `Cookie` class defined in package: `javax.servlet.http` (automatically imported)
- Cookie API
    - Constructor: `Cookie(String name, String value)`
    - Set life span: `cookie.setMaxAge(int second)`
    - Send cookie to browser: `response.addCookie(Cookie c)`
    - Read cookies: `Cookie[] theCookies = request.getCookies();`
        
        - these cookies are all specific to the webserver.

- Max of 20 cookies per domain
- How cookies work in a typical web interaction
    
    > According to GPT
    > 
    > 1. **Server Creates a Cookie**: When a user interacts with a website, the web server can generate a cookie and include it in the HTTP response sent back to the user's browser. The cookie is typically set in the response headers and contains key-value pairs along with other attributes like expiration date and domain.
    > 2. **Browser Receives and Stores the Cookie**: The user's web browser receives the HTTP response, including the cookie information, and stores it locally on the user's device. The browser keeps track of the cookies associated with each website or domain.
    > 3. **Browser Sends Cookies with Subsequent Requests**: When the user makes further requests to the same website (e.g., by clicking links or submitting forms), the browser automatically includes the relevant cookies associated with that website in the HTTP request headers. This allows the server to identify and recognize the user or maintain session state.
    > 4. **Server Accesses and Utilizes the Cookie Data**: The web server, upon receiving the HTTP request, can access the cookies sent by the browser. The server reads the cookie data to retrieve information, such as user preferences, authentication status, or other session-related data. It can use this information to personalize the user's experience or maintain session state.

- Server Reponse和JSP加载好的html页面同时返回到浏览器

# JSP Tags

- Benefits
    - Minimize the amount of scriplet code in JSP
    - Avoid dumping thousands of lines of code in a JSP
    - Main focus of JSP is only the presentation
    - Tag is reusable
- Add two jar files first
- Every page that uses the Core tags must include this reference
    
    `<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" prefix="c" %>`
    

```HTML
<c:set var="stuff" value="<%= new java.util.Date() %>"/>

Time on the server is ${stuff}
```

# 问题总结

1. idea无法识别 `out.println()` （其实无法识别也能正常运行）
    1. 将Tomcat/lib/servlet-api.jar 和 Tomcat/lib/jsp-api.jar加到WEB-INF/lib
    2. 右键选中jar文件，add as library
2. Difference between pageContext and session
    
    > **PageContext** has a set of attributes that are different from the Session object.
    
    > The attributes set on PageContext are only available for a given page. The attributes are not available to other pages or servlets in the application.
    
    > **Session** attributes are created per each user's session. The session attributes are unique to a given session id. Session attributes are available to other pages and servlets in the application for a given session id.
