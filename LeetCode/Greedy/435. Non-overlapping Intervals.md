- [Non-overlapping Intervals - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/description/)
- Sort with increasing left bound.
- We use sort to maintain an invariant to achieve O(n)
    - After the i th loop, the `[1, i]` intervals are all disjoint to each other.
    - So that if the new interval overlaps with its last interval, it will only overlap with its last interval. Also, if the new interval is disjoint to its previous interval, it will be disjoint all previous intervals.
- Local Optimal: If a new interval overlaps with its last interval, we will keep the one with larger right bound and remove the one with smaller right bound.

    With that, the incoming intervals are less likely to overlap. Thus, we will remove the minimum number of intervals.

    ```C++
    class Solution {
    public:
        static bool cmp (const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            // With same left bound, order of right bound doesn't matter
            return a[0] < b[0]; 
        }
        int eraseOverlapIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
            sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), cmp);
            // If there's one interval, don't need to remove any invervals
            int res = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
                // if overlap
                if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[i - 1][1]) {
                    // keep the smallest right bound
                    intervals[i][1] = min(intervals[i - 1][1], intervals[i][1]);
                    res++;
                }
                // if not overlap, no need to do anything
            }
            return res;
        }
    };
    ```
