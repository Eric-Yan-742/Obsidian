- [Queue Reconstruction by Height - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/description/)
- When we have two dimensions to consider, don’t consider both dimensions in one greedy. [[135. Candy]]
- So do we sort with k first or h first?

    - **False Approach**: Try to sort with k first, in an increasing order. If two elements have the same k, we put the element with smaller h in the front because that’s more in line with the requirement. After sort, we cannot utilize h to move element to let both k and h satisfied with the requirement. So sorting with k is useless

    - **Correct Approach**: Then try to **sort with h** first, **in a decreasing order**. If two people have the same h, we put the people with larger k afterwards because that’s more in line with the requirement. After the sort, we ensure all people in front of a person is taller than or equal to that person. Now we just insert all people to the kth position to meet the requirement.

- If we insert a person in the middle of the reconstructed array, will that break the previously maintained requirement?
	- After we sort with h, when we move a person according to k, we will not break the requirement because the person we move must be **smaller** than all people in front of him. For the case of equal height, we will not move a person to the front of another person with the same height. The order of people with the same height already meets the requirement after we sort the array.

- Version 1: using vector
    
    ```C++
    class Solution {
        static bool cmp(const vector<int>& lhs, const vector<int>& rhs) {
            if(lhs[0] == rhs[0]) {
                return lhs[1] < rhs[1];
            } else {
                return lhs[0] > rhs[0];
            }
        }
    public:
        vector<vector<int>> reconstructQueue(vector<vector<int>>& people) {
            sort(people.begin(), people.end(), cmp);
            vector<vector<int>> res;
            for(int i = 0; i < people.size(); i++) {
                // insert to kth position
                int k = people[i][1];
                res.insert(res.begin() + k, people[i]);
            }
            return res;
        }
    };
    ```
    
    Time: $O(n^2)$﻿
    
    Space: $O(n)$﻿
    
- Insertion to the beginning or the middle of a vector takes $O(n)$﻿. You need to copy the whole array to the newly allocated memory, which is slow.
- Version 2: using list.
    
    ```C++
    class Solution {
    public:
        static bool cmp(const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            if (a[0] == b[0]) return a[1] < b[1];
            return a[0] > b[0];
        }
        vector<vector<int>> reconstructQueue(vector<vector<int>>& people) {
            sort (people.begin(), people.end(), cmp);
            list<vector<int>> que;
            for (int i = 0; i < people.size(); i++) {
                int position = people[i][1];
                // you cannot use + for iterator of list
                list<vector<int>>::iterator itr = que.begin();
                advance(itr, position);
                que.insert(itr, people[i]);
            }
            return vector<vector<int>>(que.begin(), que.end());
        }
    };
    ```
    
    Time: $O(n^2)$﻿ Space: $O(n)$﻿
    
- Insertion to list also takes $O(n)$﻿, but it’s no need to copy the element.

## C++ Tricks

- For `insert` if `vec[i]` doesn’t exist yet, we cannot directly insert an element to `vec[i+1]` , it will cause a runtime error
    - For this problem, the solution guarantees that `k <= current position` , so we don’t need to worry about it.
- The predicate for `sort` can only be a callable object that can be called without an instance. So it can only be a **static** function in a class. Or you need to move it out of a class.
- Cannot do arithmetic to list’s iterator
    - You cannot directly use the `**+**` operator with a list iterator in C++. Unlike random-access iterators (such as those used with vectors and arrays), list iterators do not support arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction.
    - For list iterators, you can only increment (`**++**`) or decrement (`**--**`) them to move forward or backward in the list, respectively. To move to a specific position in the list, you would need to use other methods, such as `**std::advance**` or iterate through the list using a loop.
