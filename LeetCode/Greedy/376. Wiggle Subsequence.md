- [Wiggle Subsequence - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/description/)
- A **subsequence** is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.
    - So the elements in the subsequence **don’t have to be adjacent** to each other in the original sequence.
    - Sliding window doesn’t work.
- A sequence with one element and a sequence with **two non-equal** elements are trivially wiggle sequences.
- Local Optimal: Delete all elements in the middle of a slope.

- We don’t need to actually delete this element in the array. We can set a variable for counting. When there’s alternative (two sides’ differences have different signs), we increment the variable. When there’s no alternative (two sides’ differences have the same signs, the variable remains the same.
- It sounds easy, but we also need to consider the case of **flat slope**

    Do we need to increment length when one side’s diff is 0?
    
- I prefer to get rid of all flat slope first (remove consecutive duplicates) since they don’t contribute to the length. The flat slope creates a lot of edge cases that’s difficult to take all of them into account.
- Also, we need to pay special attention to **two end points**. They only have one side difference, so we cannot use the same logic of points in the middle for them, but they still contribute to the overall length.
    
    `[0]` has length 1
    
    `[0, 1]` has length 2
    
    `[1, 0]`has length 2
    
    `[1, 1]` has length 1
    
    `[1, 2, 1]` has length 3
    
    `[3, 2, 1]` has length 2
    
    The pattern is that. The array has length of at least 1. Let’s say the starting point always add 1 to length. For the end point, if it’s different from the previous elements, no matter it’s the starting point or a point in the middle, it adds 1 to the length.
    
- My version
    
    ```C++
    int wiggleMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        // use two pointers to remove flat slope
        // and keep the original order
        // slow points to the next element of the resized array. 
        int slow = 1;
        for(int fast = 1; fast < nums.size(); fast++) {
            if(nums[fast] != nums[fast - 1]) {
                nums[slow] = nums[fast];
                slow++;
            }
        }
        nums.resize(slow);
        // the code below assumes the array has at least
        // one starting point and one ending point, so
        // size == 1 becomes an edge case. 
        
        // Note!!! We must put it here instead of the
        // very beginnning because an array with all
        // same elements like [0,0,0] will be trimmed to
        // [0], size == 1 as well. 
        if(nums.size() == 1) return 1;
        // add 2 endpoints, they must be part of the wiggle
        int length = 2;
        int n = nums.size();
        // check points in the middle
        for(int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
            int leftDiff = nums[i] - nums[i - 1];
            int rightDiff = nums[i + 1] - nums[i];
            if((leftDiff > 0 && rightDiff < 0) ||
                    (leftDiff < 0 && rightDiff > 0)) {
                length++;
            }
        }
        return length;
    }
    ```
    
- Since the array has no repeated elements, 
- A more concise version that doesn’t remove flat, but actually much more difficult to come up on your own.
