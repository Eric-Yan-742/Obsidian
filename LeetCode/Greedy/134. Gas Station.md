- Greedy Proof:
    - If the sum of gas is smaller than negative gas, then there’s no valid starting point.
    - Let’s say we have a surplus array such that `surplus[i] = gas[i] - cos[i]` . For an interval [a,b], if the cumulative sum of `surplus[a] + surplus[a + 1] + ... + surplue[b] > 0`, we can say that we can drive from a to b.
        - So that if the sum of surplus is positive, index 0 is a valid and the only valid starting point. (The problem guaratees that there’s only one valid starting point if there exists one).
    - Say if we add the cumulative sum `curSum` from index 0, if `curSum[a] < 0` , we know that `[0, a]` are all invalid starting points because if we choose any point in this interval, they will all run out of gas at `a` .

        - How do we prove that if we choose an index `b` in the interval `(0, a)` , the cumulative sum of `[b, a]` must be negative? i.e. how do we prove all starting points at and before `a` are all invalid.

        - Suppose interval 2’s sum > 0. Since we know interval 1’s sum + interval 2’s sum < 0, so interval 1’s sum < 0.
        - Then we would choose `b` to be a valid starting point and reset `curSum = 0` . We would not continue adding `curSum` until `a` . Contradiction.
    - Another concern: We know that all position excluded by negative `curSum` are indeed invalid. But how do we know the position we finally choose must be valid?
        - The starting position we choose is not blocked by negative `curSum` in the rest of the array.
        - If we also know that `totalSum` of surplus is greater than 0, this starting position must be valid. On the other hands, there cannot be any valid starting point.
        - `totalSum < 0` is equivalent to `curSum[n - 1] < 0`

- Use `totalSum` to determine the values to return:
	1. `curSum` can help us exclude positions that are not possible. However, that doesn't mean values that are not excluded by `curSum` must be valid. 
	2. If `totalSum < 0` , there cannot be valid positions. If `totalSum >= 0` , there must be valid positions, which means the **possible interval** (`[startPos, n - 1]`) that is not excluded by `curSum` must contain the valid position. 
	3. Among the points that’s possible to be valid (is not blocked by negative curSum), the left most point has the biggest chance to pass because the interval starting at the leftmost must have the biggest sum. Since the problem guarantees a unique solution, it must be that left most point.

- **Local Optimal**: Whenever `curSum[i] < 0` set `i+1` to be the new potential starting position.

            int startPos = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < gas.size(); i++) {
                curSum += gas[i] - cost[i];
                totalSum += gas[i] - cost[i];
                if(curSum < 0) {
                    startPos = i + 1;
                    curSum = 0;
                }
            }
            // remove 2 conditions
            // 1. i == gas.size()
            // 2. valid i not blocked by negative sum
            //    but still cannot travel back to itself.
            if(totalSum < 0) return -1;
    				// if totalSum >= 0, there must exist a unique position. 
            return startPos;
        }
    };
