- [Jump Game II - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/description/)
- The problem guarantees there exists a path that can reach the last index
- We cannot jump to furthest at every index.
- Local Optimal: Keep track of the furthest we can get at this step.
- We know the coverage of the **current step** in advance. During the current step, we calculate how far we can get at the **next step**.

    With these coverages, we know that we can reach 4 in two steps. We don’t know how, but we know we can reach.
    
    We still examine how every element contributes to coverage, but we only take the largest of those contributions within a step and only update minimual step when we reach the end of the current coverage.
    
- If we are still in the current step, it means this step cannot reach the last index.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
        // edge case, the logic below returns 1
        // but we should return 0
        if(nums.size() == 1) return 0;
        // step is initially 0
        int minStep = 0;
        // with 0 step, we can only reach the first element
        int curRange = 0;
        // doesn't matter, we will overwrite it
        int nextRange = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            // prepare the next step
            nextRange = max(nextRange, i + nums[i]);
            // we've reached the end of the furthest this step can reach
            if(i == curRange) {
                // next step now
                minStep++;
                // use the nextRange we've prepared
                curRange = nextRange;
                // if the updated step already reaches the end, we return
                if(curRange >= nums.size() - 1) return minStep;
            }
        }
        // only got here if we cannot reach the last element
        // since the problem guarantees, we'll never reach here
        return minStep;
    }
};
```

Time: $O(n)$﻿

Space: $O(1)$

- **Note**: Don't forget `if(curRange >= nums.size() - 1) return minStep;`. We don't check the last interval because it may add an extra step if `nums.size() - 1` is exactly the end of the last interval like `[2, 3, 1, 1, 4]` .
