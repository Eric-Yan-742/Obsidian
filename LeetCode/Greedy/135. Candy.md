- Two Greedy
    1. Forward: If `ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]`, then `ratings[i]` must have more candies than `ratings[i - 1]` , so let `ratings[i] = ratings[i - 1] + 1` . Finally we ensure every child has more candies than his **left neighbor** if he has more ratings than his left neighbor.
    2. Backward: If `ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]`, then `ratings[i]` must have more candies than `ratings[i + 1]` , so let `ratings[i] = ratings[i + 1] + 1` . Finally we ensure every child has more candies than his **right neighbor** if he has more ratings than his **right** neighbor.
    3. We need to make every child to have more candies than **both of his neighbors**, so we need to take the maximum of left result and right result.

    ```C++
    class Solution {
    public:
        int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
            int n = ratings.size();
            vector<int> forward(n, 1);
            // forward
            for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                if(ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
                    forward[i] = forward[i - 1] + 1;
                }
            }
            // backward
            vector<int> backward(n, 1);
            for(int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
                if(ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
                    backward[i] = backward[i + 1] + 1;
                }
            }
            // take maximum
            int res = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                res += max(forward[i], backward[i]);
            }
            return res;
        }
    };
