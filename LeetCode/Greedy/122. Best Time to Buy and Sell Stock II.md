- [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/description/)
- A positive profit needs at least 2 days. Buy an sell on the same day earns 0 profit

## My version

![[_attachments/Untitled 10.jpeg|Untitled 10.jpeg]]

- Local optimal: sell the yesterday’s stock whenever price decreases.
- Code
    
    ```C++
    class Solution {
    public:
        int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
            int profit = 0;
            int total = 0;
            int buy = 0;
            for(int sell = 1; sell < prices.size(); sell++) {
                // sell previous increasing interval
                if(prices[sell] < prices[sell - 1]) {
                    total += profit;
                    // reset interval profit to 0
                    profit = 0;
                    // reset interval
                    buy = sell;
                } else {
                    // if price increases, don't sell, update price
                    profit = prices[sell] - prices[buy];
                }
            }
            // for the last interval
            total += profit;
            return total;
        }
    };
    ```
    
- Edge Case:
    
    - We only sell stock when there’s an decrease, so if the **last interval** is an increase, we miss it. That’s why we add profit to total at the end. If the price decreases on the last day, we just add 0 to total.

    - For there’s only one day, we just return 0.

## More concise version

- Local optimal: decompose interval’s profit into each day’s profit. And we only take positive profit
    
    ![[_attachments/Untitled 32.png|Untitled 32.png]]
    
    First day’s profit is just 0, no need to record it.
    
- This is actually the same as my version that only records increasing interval. But this version avoids the edge case of the last interval.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int total = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            int today = prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            if(today > 0) {
                total += today; 
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
};
```
