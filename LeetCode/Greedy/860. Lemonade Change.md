- [Lemonade Change - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/description/)
- Three Condition
    1. Customer pays 5, we don’t need to change, just receive it.
    2. Customer pays 10, we must change a 5 to the customer
    3. Customer pays 20, we can either change 5 + 10 and 5+5+5
- We can see that the first two conditions leave us not space to choose. For the last condition, we should put 5 + 10 to priority because 5 is more versatile
- Local Optimal: When a customer pays 20, we should use 5+10 first to consume 10s. If we don’t have 10, then we use 5+5+5.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool lemonadeChange(vector<int>& bills) {
        // how many five and ten in hand
        // twenty is useless, so no need to keep track of
        int five = 0;
        int ten = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < bills.size(); i++) {
            // for 5 we just receive
            if(bills[i] == 5) {
                five++;
            } else if(bills[i] == 10) {
                // for 10 we can only change with five
                if(five > 0) {
                    five--;
                    ten++;
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            } else if(bills[i] == 20){
                // for 20 we put 10+5 to priority
                if(five > 0 && ten > 0) {
                    five--;
                    ten--;
                } else if(five >= 3){
                    five -= 3;
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true; 
    }
};
