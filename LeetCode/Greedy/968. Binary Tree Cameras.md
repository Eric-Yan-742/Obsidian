- [Binary Tree Cameras - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/description/)
- My thought: Use BFS for this tree. Add monitor to all levels with odd height

    But couldn’t deal with this case. We only need one camera, but we will put 2.

- Local Optimal: For leave nodes, we put a camera on its parent to maximize its coverage. For nodes further up, we put a camera every two nodes
- Because we traverse the tree upward, we should use post-order traversal.
- How do we place a camera every two nodes?
    - We set 3 states that partition the whole set of cameras
		0. The node is not covered
        1. The node has a camera
        2. The node is covered
    - Say the current node has a camera. For its parent node, the state is covered. For its grandparents node, the state is not covered. Then we should place a camera at its great- grand parent. (For a linear tree it’s really simple).
- To put a camera at the parent of each leave node, leave node’s state should be uncovered. So **null node’s state should be covered.**
- Now we’ve dealt with base case. For the recursion logic, since we need to deal with two children nodes, we can split all possible combinations of two states into 3 cases to achieve our local optimal.

    Notice there’s an intersection between case 2 and case 3. This intersection is the case that one of the child has a camera and the other child is not covered. In this case, parent must have a camera to cover that child although it seems wasteful. Thus, we should apply the logic of case 2 to this intersection.

- There is also an edge case beside the general logic.
    
    ![[_attachments/Untitled 1 14.png|Untitled 1 14.png]]
    
    With our case 2 logic, the root node may be left uncovered because it doesn’t have parent. In that case we need an additional camera at the root although it seems wasteful.
    
- The purpose of this complex case analysis is that **we need to consider all the cases and treat each case correctly**
    
    ```C++
    class Solution {
    public:
        int res;
        // return the state of this node.
        int traverse(TreeNode* root) {
            // Base Case
            if(root == nullptr) return 2;
    
            int leftState = traverse(root->left);
            int rightState = traverse(root->right);
            // case 1
            if(leftState == 2 && rightState == 2) {
                return 0;
            }
            // case 2
            if(leftState == 0 || rightState == 0) {
                res++;
                return 1;
            }
            // case 3
            if(leftState == 1 || rightState == 1) {
                return 2;
            }
            // we will not reach here. b/c we've considered all the cases. 
            return -1;
        }
        int minCameraCover(TreeNode* root) {
            res = 0;
            // edge case: root cannot be left uncovered
            if(traverse(root) == 0) {
                res++;
            }
            return res;
        }
    };
    ```
    
    Time: $O(n)$﻿ Space: $O(1)$﻿
    
- Case 1’s order doesn’t matter because it’s disjoint with other cases. Case 2 must be placed before Case 3 for the reason I explained above.
