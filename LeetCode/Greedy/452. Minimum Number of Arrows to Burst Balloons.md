- [Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/description/)
- Sort by increasing left bound
- We use sort to maintain an invariant to achieve O(n)
    - If a ballon is disjoint with the last group, it’s disjoint to all previous groups. If a ballon overlaps with the last group, it will only overlap with the last group.
- If the new ballon overlaps with the last group, we keep smallest right bound and remove the parts exceeding the smallest right bound.

    So that we can really make sure if the next ballon can be added to this group and be shot with the same arrow.
    
- Local Optimal: We only use a new arrow when a the new ballon cannot be shot with the same arrow.

    ```C++
    class Solution {
        static bool cmp(vector<int>& lhs, vector<int>& rhs) {
            return lhs[0] < rhs[0];
        }
    public:
        int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
            sort(points.begin(), points.end());
            int res = 1;
            for(int i = 1; i < points.size(); i++) {
                // if we need a new arrow
                if(points[i][0] > points[i - 1][1]) {
                    res++;
                    // we don't need to update right bound
                    // because for a new group, the first interval's
                    // right bound must be the smallest right bound.
                } else { // if we don't need a new arrow
                    // Ensure this interval's right bound is the smallest right bound
                    // of this group. for the comparison fo the next interval
                    points[i][1] = min(points[i-1][1], points[i][1]);
                }
            }
            return res;
        }
    };
