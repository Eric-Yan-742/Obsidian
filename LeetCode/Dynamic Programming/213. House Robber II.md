- This problem is nearly the same as [[198. House Robber]]. The problem with the previous solution is that we may return a combination that include both the start index and the end index, which doesnâ€™t work in this case.
- Therefore, with the previous logic, we should not consider the start and the end at the same time. The 2 cases below will cover all the combinations we need to consider.
- Case 1: Consider the start but not the last.

- Case 2: Consider the last but no the start

- We return the max of the results from the 2 cases.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.size() == 1) return nums[0];
        
        int case1 = robNoCircle(nums, 0, nums.size() - 2);
        int case2 = robNoCircle(nums, 1, nums.size() - 1);

        return max(case1, case2);
    }
    // start and end are inclusive
    int robNoCircle(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {
        // note we need another edge case here.
        // in case nums has length 2.
        if(start == end) return nums[start];
        vector<int> dp(end + 1, 0);
        dp[start] = nums[start];
        dp[start + 1] = max(nums[start], nums[start + 1]);
        for(int i = start + 2; i <= end; i++) {
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i]);
        }
        return dp[end];
    }
};
```
