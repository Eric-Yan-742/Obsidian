- Definition:
    - `dp[i][0]` : The max profit of holding the stock, regardless of times of transactions before.
    - `dp[i][1]` : The max profit of not holding the stock, regardless of times of transactions before. So it can be do nothing, sell the 1st transaction, sell the 2nd transactionâ€¦
- Recurrence Relation:
    - `dp[i][0] = max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]);` Because we can buy and sell stock for multiple times, we may have the profit from selling stock before, not necessarily 0. Thus, we subtract from the max profit we can get yesterday.
    - `dp[i][1] = max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i]);`
- Initialization
    - `dp[0][0] = -prices[0]` : No matter we buy the stock for how many times, the profit is all `-prices[0]`
    - `dp[0][1] = 0` : No matter doing nothing, buying once and selling, buying twice and selling, the profit are all 0.
- Traversal Order: left to right.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(prices.size(), vector<int>(2));
        dp[0][0] = -prices[0];
        dp[0][1] = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            dp[i][0] = max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]);
            dp[i][1] = max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i]);
        }
        return dp[prices.size() - 1][1];
    }
};
