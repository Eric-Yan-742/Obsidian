# Dynamic Programming

- Definition:
    - `dp[i][0]` : The max profit of holding the stock, regardless of times of transactions before.
    - `dp[i][1]` : The max profit of not holding the stock, regardless of times of transactions before. So it can be do nothing, sell the 1st transaction, sell the 2nd transaction…
- Recurrence Relation:
    - `dp[i][0] = max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]);` Because we can buy and sell stock for multiple times, we may have the profit from selling stock before, not necessarily 0. Thus, we subtract from the max profit we can get yesterday.
    - `dp[i][1] = max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i]);`
- Initialization
    - `dp[0][0] = -prices[0]` : No matter we buy the stock for how many times, the profit is all `-prices[0]`
    - `dp[0][1] = 0` : No matter doing nothing, buying once and selling, buying twice and selling, the profit are all 0.
- Traversal Order: left to right.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(prices.size(), vector<int>(2));
        dp[0][0] = -prices[0];
        dp[0][1] = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            dp[i][0] = max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]);
            dp[i][1] = max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i]);
        }
        return dp[prices.size() - 1][1];
    }
};
```

# Greedy

## My version

![[_attachments/Untitled 10.jpeg|Untitled 10.jpeg]]

- Local optimal: sell the yesterday’s stock whenever price decreases. So that in a global optimal, we will record all the non-decreasing interval to get the max profit. 
- Code
    
    ```C++
    class Solution {
    public:
        int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
            int profit = 0;
            int total = 0;
            int buy = 0;
            for(int sell = 1; sell < prices.size(); sell++) {
                // sell previous increasing interval
                if(prices[sell] < prices[sell - 1]) {
                    total += profit;
                    // reset interval profit to 0
                    profit = 0;
                    // reset interval
                    buy = sell;
                } else {
                    // if price increases, don't sell, update price
                    profit = prices[sell] - prices[buy];
                }
            }
            // for the last interval
            total += profit;
            return total;
        }
    };
    ```
    
- Edge Case:
    
    - We only sell stock when there’s an decrease, so if the **last interval** is an increase, we miss it. That’s why we add profit to total at the end. If the price decreases on the last day, we just add 0 to total.
    
    ![[_attachments/Untitled 1 3.jpeg|Untitled 1 3.jpeg]]
    
    - For there’s only one day, we just return 0.

## More concise version

- Local optimal: decompose interval’s profit into each day’s profit. And we only take positive profit
    
    ![[_attachments/Untitled 32.png|Untitled 32.png]]
    
    First day’s profit is just 0, no need to record it.
    
- This is actually the same as my version that only records increasing interval. But this version avoids the edge case of the last interval.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int total = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            int today = prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            if(today > 0) {
                total += today; 
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
};
```
