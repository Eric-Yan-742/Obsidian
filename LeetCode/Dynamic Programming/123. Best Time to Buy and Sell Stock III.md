- [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/description/)

1. Definition:
    - `dp[i][0]` : max profit if we don’t buy and don’t sell. Thus, it would always be 0
    - `dp[i][1]` : max profit when we hold the stock for the **first** time.
    - `dp[i][2]` : max profit when we don’t hold the stock for the **first** time.
    - `dp[i][3]` : max profit when we hold the stock for the **second** time.
    - `dp[i][4]` : max profit when we don’t hold the stock for the **second** time.
2. Recurrence Relation: Similar mechanism as [[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock]]. We build on the first time when we hold and don’t hold the stock.
    - `dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0]`
    - `dp[i][1] = max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] - prices[i])`
    - `dp[i][2] = max(dp[i - 1][2], dp[i - 1][1] + prices[i])`
    - `dp[i][3] = max(dp[i - 1][3], dp[i - 1][2] - prices[i])`
    - `dp[i][4] = max(dp[i - 1][4], dp[i - 1][3] + prices[i])`
    - At the end, we return `dp[prices.size()][4]` , which is the state of not holding the stock for the second time. Although we don’t have to do two transaction, the max profit of doing 2 transaction ≥ doing 1 transaction. Say for the best strategy of one transaction, we buy and sell the stock on the same day. That’s already 2 transaction.

- Initialization
    - `dp[0][0] = 0`
    - `dp[0][1] = -prices[0]` Buy on the first day.
    - `dp[0][2] = 0` . Buy and sell on the first day
    - `dp[0][3] = -prices[0]` Buy and sell and buy on the first day
    - `dp[0][4] = 0` Buy and sell and buy on the first day.
- Traversal Order: left to right

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(5));
        dp[0][0] = 0;
        dp[0][1] = -prices[0];
        dp[0][2] = 0;
        dp[0][3] = -prices[0];
        dp[0][4] = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0];
            dp[i][1] = max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] - prices[i]);
            dp[i][2] = max(dp[i - 1][2], dp[i - 1][1] + prices[i]);
            dp[i][3] = max(dp[i - 1][3], dp[i - 1][2] - prices[i]);
            dp[i][4] = max(dp[i - 1][4], dp[i - 1][3] + prices[i]);
        }
        return dp[n - 1][4];
    }
};
