- [House Robber III - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/description/)

1. Definition: For each node, we define a length-2 dp array for it. Consider the subtree with the current node as the root. `dp[0]` is the max amount we can get if we don’t take the root. `dp[1]` is the max amount we can get if we take the root. So for this root (current node), the max amount is max(dp[0], dp[1]).
2. Recurrence relation: Because we have to record 2 states for each node, we have 2 relations
    1. Assume `left` is the dp array of the left subtree, `right` is the dp array of the right subtree.
    2. `dp[0] = max(left[0], left[1]) + max(right[0], right[1])` If we don’t take the root, we may or may not take the two children of the root. Take the max amount of the 2 subtrees.
    3. `dp[1] = root->val + left[0] + right[0]` If we take the root, we cannot take the 2 children, so left[0] and right[0] are the max in this case.
3. Initialization: For the null nodes at the bottom, we initialize `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[1] = 0` at the base case of the recurrsion
4. Traversal Order: post-order traversal of the tree.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> treeDp(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root == nullptr) return {0, 0};
        vector<int> left = treeDp(root->left);
        vector<int> right = treeDp(root->right);

        int notTake = max(left[0], left[1]) + max(right[0], right[1]);
        int take = root->val + left[0] + right[0];
        return {notTake, take};
    }
    int rob(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> dp = treeDp(root);
        return max(dp[0], dp[1]);
    }
};
```

- Note: we don’t use `vector<int>&` here. Each stack of recurrence needs its own array.
