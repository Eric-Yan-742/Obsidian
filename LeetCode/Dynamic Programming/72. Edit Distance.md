- [Edit Distance - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/description/)

1. Definition: `dp[i][j]` means the minimum number of steps to make `word1[0 : i - 1]` and `word2[0 : j - 1]` the same.
2. Recurrence Relation: 
    
    ```Java
    if(word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]) 
    	dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
    else
    	dp[i][j] = 
    ```
    
    1. `if(word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1])` , `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]` No operations needed
    2. Delete: `dp[i - 1][j] + 1` See [[583. Delete Operation for Two Strings]]
    3. Add: `dp[i][j - 1] + 1`
        
        Why is deleting one element from word2 the same as adding one element to word1?

        Consider the words in the green interval to be the same. Although they don’t look the same, the dp array records the min number of steps to make them the same.
        
    4. Substitute: `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1` . Substitute one of `word1[i - 1]` or `word2[j - 1]` . They will be the same. Substitute can achieve equality from `dp[i - 1][j - 1]` (a smaller range) in one step. That’s impossible for delete and add.
3. Traversal Order: See [[583. Delete Operation for Two Strings]]

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        int n1 = word1.size(), n2 = word2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n1 + 1, vector<int>(n2 + 1));
        for(int i = 0; i <= n1; i++) dp[i][0] = i;
        for(int j = 0; j <= n2; j++) dp[0][j] = j;

        for(int i = 1; i <= n1; i++) {
            for(int j = 1; j <= n2; j++) {
                if(word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j] + 1, min(dp[i][j - 1] + 1,
                            dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1));
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n1][n2];
    }
};
```
