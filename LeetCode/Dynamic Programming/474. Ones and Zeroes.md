- [Ones and Zeroes - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/ones-and-zeroes/description/)
- Because we want the maximum number of items we can carry, each item has value 1. Compared to previous questions, we have two dimensions now, the number of 0s and the number of 1s. The bag has capacity m and n. Each item has weight (# of its 0s `x` and # of its 1s `y`).

1. Definition of dp array: `dp[i][j]` how many items we can carry with at most i 0s and j 1s.
2. Initialization: `dp[0][0] = 0` `dp[i][j] = 0` . If we don’t consider any items, the max number of items we can bring is 0.
3. Recurrence Relation: `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - x][j - y] + 1)`
4. Traversal Item: item first then capacity. When traversing the 2D array, right to left + down to up and down to up + right to left are both fine. We we will not use updated grid.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxForm(vector<string>& strs, int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
        // copy by reference avoid overhead copying
        for(string& s: strs) {
            int x = 0, y = 0;
            // find how many 0s and 1s in s
            for(char c: s) {
                if(c == '0') x++;
                else y++;
            }
            // we can swap the nested order of these 2 loops
            for(int i = m; i >= x; i--) {
                for(int j = n; j >= y; j--) {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - x][j - y] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```

Say k = strs.size(), h = s.size()

Time: $O(k * (h + mn))$﻿. Space: $O(mn)$
