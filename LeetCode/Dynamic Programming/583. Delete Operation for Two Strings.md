# DP 1

- Use [[1143. Longest Common Subsequence]]. subtract `dp[n1][n2]` from n1 and `dp[n1][n2]` from n2. Sum them together. We get the minimum number of steps.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        int n1 = word1.size(), n2 = word2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n1 + 1, vector<int>(n2 + 1, 0));
        for(int i = 1; i <= n1; i++) {
            for(int j = 1; j <= n2; j++) {
                if(word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1])
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                else
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
        return n1 - dp[n1][n2]  + n2 - dp[n1][n2];
    }
};
```

# DP 2

1. Definition: `dp[i][j]` means the minimum steps to delete to make `word1[0 : i - 1]` and `word2[0 : j - 1]` the same.
2. Recurrence Relation
	1. If `word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]` , we donâ€™t need to delete anything. Thus, we just borrow from `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`
	2. If they are **not equal**, 2 cases to consider to make two strings equal again.
        1. Delete from word1, 1 step needed
        2. Delete from word2, 1 step needed
	3. Why we don't need to consider the case of deleting 2 chars from both strings? With our traversal order, `dp[i - 1][j - 1]` have been considered by `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]` when we reach `dp[i][j]`. 
3. Initialization: When one of the string is empty, we need to delete the whole other string to make them equal. Thus, `dp[i][0] = i` and `dp[0][j] = j`
4. Traversal Order: left to right, up to down.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        int n1 = word1.size(), n2 = word2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n1 + 1, vector<int>(n2 + 1, 0));
        for(int i = 0; i <= n1; i++) dp[i][0] = i;
        for(int j = 0; j <= n2; j++) dp[0][j] = j;
        for(int i = 1; i <= n1; i++) {
            for(int j = 1; j <= n2; j++) {
                if(word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1])
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                else
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j] + 1, min(dp[i][j - 1] + 1);
            }
        }
        return dp[n1][n2];
    }
};
```
