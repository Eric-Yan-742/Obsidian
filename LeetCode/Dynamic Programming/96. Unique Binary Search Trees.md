    Note it’s `*` , not `+` .
    

1. `dp[i]` means number of unique BST’s which has exactly i nodes of unique integers from 1 to i.
2. Recurrence relation: For all i ≥ 1, 1≤j≤i, `dp[i] += dp[j - 1] + dp[i - j]` , which corresponds to number of nodes on the left and number of nodes on the right.
    
    1. For each i, it will use `dp[0]` to `dp[i - 1]` , like a strong induction.

3. Initialization: `dp[0] = 1` , empty binary tree is also a BST, only one unqiue BST is possible.
4. Traversal Order: front to back.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int numTrees(int n) {
        vector<int> dp(n + 1);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for(int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j];
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
