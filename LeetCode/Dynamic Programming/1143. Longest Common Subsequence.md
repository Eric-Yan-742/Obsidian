- [Longest Common Subsequence - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/description/)
- Elements don’t have to be contiguous in subsequences.

1. Definition: `dp[i][j]` means the max length of common subsequence in the range `[0, i - 1]` of `nums1` and `[0, j - 1]` of `nums2` .
    - Note: the definition doesn’t require the subsequence to **end** at `nums1[i - 1]`  and `nums2[j - 1]` . We do it because it’s easy to **maintain range** with the nature of common subsequence.
2. Recurrence Relation: 
    
    ```Java
    if(nums1[i - 1] == nums2[j - 1]) 
    	dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
    else
    	dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    ```
    
    - If the current two elements are equal, we can confidently add one to the max length `dp[i - 1][j - 1]` . We don’t need to care about the relationship with the previous elements, contiguous or not, greater or not, so we don’t need to care about values of all previous values in the dp array. That’s why we use range, not ending with this element, as the definition for this problem. Compared to [[300. Longest Increasing Subsequence]]
    - `max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])` . If not equal, we search the biggest range other than including both `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]` . Because of the nature of common subsequence, we don’t have to look up all previous values.

3. Initialization: first row, first column 0. Same as [[718. Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray]]
4. Traversal Order: left to right, up to down.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        int n1 = text1.size(), n2 = text2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n1 + 1, vector<int>(n2 + 1, 0));
        for(int i = 1; i <= n1; i++) {
            for(int j = 1; j <= n2; j++) {
                if(text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1])
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                else
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
        return dp[n1][n2];
    }
};
