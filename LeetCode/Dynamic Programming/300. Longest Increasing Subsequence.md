- [Longest Increasing Subsequence - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/description/)
- Note that elements in the subsequence may not be contiguous to each other in the array.

1. Definition: `dp[i]` means the max length of the subsequence that ends with the ith element
2. Recurrence relation: Traverse all elements before ith, which are `dp[j]` . If `nums[i] > nums[j]` , then the subsequence `dp[j]` plus `nums[i]` is strictly increasing. We want to find the max subsequence. Thus, `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` .
3. Initialization:
    - `dp[0] = 1` according to the definition
    - `dp[i] = 1` for the convenience of the calculation later.
4. Traversal order: left to right

- According to the definition, note that we want to return t**he max element of the dp array** instead of `dp[n - 1]`.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> dp(n, 1);
        int result = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if(nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                }
            }
            // get the max
            result = max(result, dp[i]);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
