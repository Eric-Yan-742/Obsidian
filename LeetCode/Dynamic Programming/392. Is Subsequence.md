- [Is Subsequence - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/description/)

1. Definition: `dp[i][j]` means the longest **subarray** ending with `s[i - 1]` in `s` that is a subsequence in `t[0, j - 1]`.
2. Recurrence Relation: 
    
    ```Cpp
    if(s[i - 1] == t[j - 1])
    	dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
    else
    	dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
    ```
    
    - Comparison with [[1143. Longest Common Subsequence]]

    - Without the option `dp[i - 1][j]` , we lost the ability to delete element in `s`
3. Initialization: first row and first column 0, same as [[1143. Longest Common Subsequence]]
4. Traversal Order: left to right, up to down.

- With the definition of the dp array, `dp[s.size()][t.size()]` must be equal to size of `s`. Or `s` cannot be a **subsequence of** `t`

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(s.size() + 1, vector<int>(t.size() + 1, 0));
        for(int i = 1; i <= s.size(); i++) {
            for(int j = 1; j <= t.size(); j++) {
                if(s[i - 1] == t[j - 1])
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                else
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1];
            }
        }
        return dp[s.size()][t.size()] == s.size();
    }
};
```
