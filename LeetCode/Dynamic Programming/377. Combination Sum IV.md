# Complete Knapsack

- Although the problem says combination, we need permutation instead of combination in this problem.
- Complete knapsack, defintion, recurrence relation, and initialization are the same as [[518. Coin Change II]]

1. Traversal order: To get permutation, we need the capacity loop to be outside and item loop to be inside. Also mentioned in [[518. Coin Change II]]

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int combinationSum4(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        // one test case adds 2 nums that exceed the limit of INT_MAX
        // so we use a larger integer type. 
        vector<unsigned long> dp(target + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for(int j = 0; j <= target; j++) {
            for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
                if(j >= nums[i]) dp[j] += dp[j - nums[i]];
            }
        }
        return dp[target];
    }
};
```

# Climbing Stairs

- See this [[70. Climbing Stairs]] problem. Now we expand on this problem to say that `nums` contains all the steps we can take to climb the stairs.
- Definition: Say `dp[i]` is how many ways we are able to climb to the ith stair.
- Recurrence Relation: `dp[i] = dp[i] + dp[i - nums[j]]` for all `nums[j]`. `dp[i]` starting with 0. We then traverse all possible `nums[j]` that we can reach `dp[i]` from `dp[i - nums[j]]`. Like a strong induction.

- Initialization: `dp[0] = 1` means there is one way to reach the 0th stair, which is doing nothing. 
- Traversal Order: Outer stairs, inner steps (`nums` ).

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int combinationSum4(vector<int>& nums, int target) { 
        vector<unsigned long> dp(target + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i <= target; i++) {
            // consider all possible ways of stepping
            for(int j = 0; j < nums.size(); j++) {
                // sum them together
                if(i >= nums[j]) dp[i] += dp[i - nums[j]];
            }
        }
        return dp[target];
    }
};
```
