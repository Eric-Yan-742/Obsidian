2. Recurrence relation: same as [[494. Target Sum]]. Traverse from left to right in the way of complete knapsack.
3. Initialization: same as [[494. Target Sum]]
4. Traversal Order: row by row, left to right (complete knapsack).

- We cannot traverse column by column unlike the pure complete knapsack [[Complete Knapsack Problem]]. Look at this example

    In the case of column by column, we will consider each item multiple times, which makes the result to be number of permutations.
    

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
        vector<int> dp(amount + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < coins.size(); i++) {
            for(int j = coins[i]; j <= amount; j++) {
                dp[j] += dp[j - coins[i]];
            }
        }
        return dp[amount];
    }
};
```

Time: $O(n^2)$﻿, coins[i] = 1
