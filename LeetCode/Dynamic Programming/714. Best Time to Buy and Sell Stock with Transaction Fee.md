- [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/description/)
- Definition: The same as [[LeetCode/Dynamic Programming/122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II|122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II]]. Note that `dp[i][0]` and `dp[i][1]` consider all possible times of buying and selling
- Recurrence Relation: See [[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock]]. For the transaction fee, we can charge at the time we buy the stock or at the time we sell the stock. The point is that we can only **charge it** **once for one buy and sell.** If we charge it when we sell the stock, the relation would be:
    - `dp[i][0] = max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]);`
    - `dp[i][1] = max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i] - fee);`
- Initialization: If we charge the fee when we sell the stock, for `dp[0][0]` , itâ€™s basically the same as [[LeetCode/Dynamic Programming/122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II|122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II]].
    - `dp[0][1] = max(0, -fee)` : If we do nothing (0 transactions), the profit is 0. For the rest times of transactions, the profit is -fee when we buy and sell on the same day. Thus, the max profit is -fee here.
- Traversal Order: left to right.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        int n = prices.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(2));
        dp[0][0] = -prices[0];
        dp[0][1] = max(0, -fee);
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]);
            dp[i][1] = max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i] - fee);
        }
        return dp[n - 1][1];
    }
};
