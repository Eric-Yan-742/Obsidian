- $\binom{n}{k}$﻿
- $k=2$﻿ uses 2 nested for loops, $k=3$﻿ uses 3 nested for loops, how about $k=50$﻿?
- Using backtracking
    - ![[_attachments/Untitled 18.png|Untitled 18.png]]
    - The first level is equivalent to k=1. The second level is equivalent to k=2 …
    - A directed graph with vertices and edges like this. Because DFS doesn't visit visited vertices, multiple vertices have the same values. 
    - ![[4caa9ca565db7d55a48d4e9b87bfee5.jpg]]
    - We run a DFS on this graph and record all the paths (length < 2). 
    
- No optimization version
    
    ```C++
    class Solution {
    private:
        vector<int> path;
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        void backtracking(int n, int k, int startIdx) {
            // base case, when path is long enough
            if(path.size() == k) {
                res.push_back(path);
                return;
            }
            // check all paths start with startidx
            for(int i = startIdx; i <= n; i++) {
                path.push_back(i);
                // To avoid repeating, increment startIdx
                // for the next level. 
                backtracking(n, k, i + 1);
                // backtracking, pop the element of 
                // next level
                path.pop_back();
            }
        }
    public:
        vector<vector<int>> combine(int n, int k) {
            backtracking(n, k, 1);
            return res;
        }
    };
    ```
    
    - Will traverse through some invalid branches. For instance, n=4 k=2, and we start from 4.
- Optimization (remove some branches)

    - Why is `n - i + 1 >= k - path.size()` ?
	    - ![[_attachments/Untitled 6.jpeg|Untitled 6.jpeg]]
	    - `n - i + 1` is how many numbers are left to choose. `k - path.size()` is how many numbers we need to add to the path. 
    
- Time Complexity: $|V| = |E|$ in this graph. Runtime is $O(|V|)$ or $O(|E|)$. $|V| <= n^n$. So a untight bound would be $O(n^n)$.

- Space Complexity: $O(k)$﻿, maximum depth of recursion
- C++ Trick
    - You cannot do `n - i >= k - path.size() - 1` although it seems the same. `path.size()` is an unsigned type, so the whole expression will be evaluated as unsigned. If `k - path.size() - 1` grows negative, the unsigned value would be huge. So this expression always holds true, which causes an infinite loop.
    - However, you can indeed convert `path.size()` to a signed type by doing `(int)path.size()`
