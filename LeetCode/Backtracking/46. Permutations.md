- [Permutations - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/description/)
- We only count $P(n, n)$﻿, we don’t consider permutation that’s shorter than the original array.
- Tree Structure

- We may go take element before in the next level, so we traverse from the beginning of the array. But we can also only use each element for once, so we need to keep track of which elements are used.
- Code
    
    ```C++
    class Solution {
    private:
        vector<int> path;
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        void backtracking(vector<int>& nums, vector<bool>& used) {
            if(path.size() == nums.size()) {
                res.push_back(path);
                return;
            }
            // we traverse from the very beginning for each level
            for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
                // If this element is used in this branch, skip it
                if(used[i]) continue;
                // record this element has been used
                used[i] = true;
                path.push_back(nums[i]);
                backtracking(nums, used);
                path.pop_back();
                used[i] = false;
            }
        }
    public:
        vector<vector<int>> permute(vector<int>& nums) {
            vector<bool> used(nums.size(), false);
            backtracking(nums, used);
            return res;
        }
    };
    ```

Different from removing duplicates in combinations/subsets, elements in the same level don't affect each other, but it will never happen anyway because there are no duplicates in this question. On the other hand, if an element has been used in the same path, we can only visit other elements in this level.

May be it's more intuitive to represent numbers in the edge and path in the node. 

- Time: $O(n!)$﻿
- Space: $O(n)$
