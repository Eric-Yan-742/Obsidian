- [Permutations - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/description/)
- We only count $P(n, n)$﻿, we don’t consider permutation that’s shorter than the original array.
- Tree Structure

- Refer to [[40. Combination Sum II]]. 
1. Scenario 1 is still the same. If we don't use the same element, path on the same branch will always be different permutations.
2. Scenario 2 will visit the same combinations in the same order. That's why we need to remove duplicates in the same level.
3. We can ignore scenario 3 right now. Although we may visit the same combinations in different orders, they are considered different permutations. Thus, there's no need to sort the array. 
- Code
    
    ```C++
    class Solution {
    private:
        vector<int> path;
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        void backtracking(vector<int>& nums, vector<bool>& used) {
            if(path.size() == nums.size()) {
                res.push_back(path);
                return;
            }
            // we traverse from the very beginning for each level
            for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
                // If this element is used in this branch, skip it
                if(used[i]) continue;
                // record this element has been used
                used[i] = true;
                path.push_back(nums[i]);
                backtracking(nums, used);
                path.pop_back();
                used[i] = false;
            }
        }
    public:
        vector<vector<int>> permute(vector<int>& nums) {
            vector<bool> used(nums.size(), false);
            backtracking(nums, used);
            return res;
        }
    };
    ```

Different from removing duplicates in combinations/subsets, elements in the same level don't affect each other, but it will never happen anyway because there are no duplicates in this question. On the other hand, if an element has been used in the same path, we can only visit other elements in this level.

May be it's more intuitive to represent numbers in the edge and path in the node.
