- [Merge Two Sorted Lists - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/)
- Note: we should not create a new list and fill the number into it. We should directly change the link of the original two lists to form the final list.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeTwoLists(ListNode* list1, ListNode* list2) {
        ListNode *dummy_head = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode *pre = dummy_head;
        // when two lists both have nodes left
        while(list1 && list2) {
            // connect the previous node to the smaller node
            // move pre forward and then list head forward
            if(list1->val <= list2->val) {
                pre->next = list1;
                pre = list1;
                list1 = list1->next;
            } else {
                pre->next = list2;
                pre = list2;
                list2 = list2->next;
            }
        }
        // one of the list is empty, the other has nodes
        // connect to the rest of the nodes. 
        if(list1) {
            pre->next = list1;
        } else {
            pre->next = list2;
        }
        return dummy_head->next;
    }
};
```

Suppose n is the total number of nodes (include all lists).

Time: $O(n)$ï»¿ (we need to do one comparison for each node)

Space: $O(1)$
