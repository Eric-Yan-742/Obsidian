[[Basics]]

- If this element is not in the loop, when do we continue and when do we return?
	- If we still want to check later elements in the same level, we continue to skip this element. We do it when later elements may still be valid. e.g. [[491. Non-decreasing Subsequences]]
	- If we don't want to check later elements in the same level, which means all elements after is impossible to be valid, we return to stop checking the whole level. e.g. [[93. Restore IP Addresses]]
- The best way to represent combinations/subsets/permutations graph is to mark nodes as the current path and edges as the element we use
