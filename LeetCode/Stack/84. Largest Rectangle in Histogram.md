- [Largest Rectangle in Histogram - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/description/)
- [[Tiktok Metrics Analysis]] This solution works for this problem perfectly.
- We can also use one stack to find the first smaller element on the right and on the left at the same time. Like [[42. Trapping Rain Water]]
- What if the previous element is equal to height[mid], instead of greater than?

    All elements in the subsequence have the same area. The leftmost element will have the correct area.
    
- Why do we need to add a zero at the end.

    If we don’t have the zero at the end, then end result will be zero because we won’t collect any areas.
    
- Why do we need to add a zero at the start?
    
    ![[114da0a7ef8cea1501fb5ad00923e13.jpg]]
    
    After popping mid, the stack will always be empty. So we will never collect any areas without the 0 too.
    
- Compare to [[42. Trapping Rain Water]]. We record the rectangle area of all the numbers with the leading and trailing zero. We will not only record the protruding pillar like below.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int largestRectangleArea(vector<int>& heights) {
        int res = 0;
        stack<int> st;
        heights.insert(heights.begin(), 0);
        heights.push_back(0);
        for(int i = 0; i < heights.size(); i++) {
            while(!st.empty() && heights[i] < heights[st.top()]) {
                int mid = st.top();
                st.pop();
                if(!st.empty()) {
                    int width = i - st.top() - 1;
                    int height = heights[mid];
                    res = max(res, height * width);
                }
            }
            st.push(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
