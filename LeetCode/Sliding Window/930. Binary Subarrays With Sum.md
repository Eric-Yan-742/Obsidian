[930. Binary Subarrays With Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/)

Compared to previous questions like [[992. Subarrays with K Different Integers]]. Note that we are not counting the number of something. Instead we are adding values together to get the sum. This kind of question is a little bit different. A negative sum/goal will totally mess up the correctness of our algorithm

- Some Experiement I did
	
	How it normally works for non-negative sum and elements

	With negative sum, left pointer will move further beyond right pointer sometimes.
