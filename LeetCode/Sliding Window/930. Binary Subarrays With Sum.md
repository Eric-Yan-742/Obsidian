[930. Binary Subarrays With Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/)

Compared to previous questions like [[992. Subarrays with K Different Integers]]. Note that we are not counting the number of something. Instead we are adding values together to get the **sum**. This kind of question is a little bit different. A negative sum/goal or negative elements in the array will totally mess up the correctness of our algorithm

	How it normally works for non-negative sum and elements

	With negative sum, left pointer will move further beyond right pointer sometimes.

The problem with negative values are that adding and subtracting the same interval like `[-1, 0, 1]` will both 



In this question, the minimum value of `goal` is 0. So `goal - 1` could be `-1`. To avoid this exception, we need to add an edge case. 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSubarraysWithSum(vector<int>& nums, int goal) {
        return atMost(nums, goal) - atMost(nums, goal - 1);
    }
    int atMost(vector<int>& nums, int goal) {
        if(goal < 0) return 0;
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int res = 0;
        while(right < nums.size()) {
            goal -= nums[right];
            right++;
            while(goal < 0) {
                goal += nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            res += right - left;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
