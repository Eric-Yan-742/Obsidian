[930. Binary Subarrays With Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/)

Compared to previous questions like [[992. Subarrays with K Different Integers]]. Note that we are not counting the number of something. Instead we are adding values together to get the **sum**. This kind of question is a little bit different. A negative sum/goal or negative elements in the array will totally mess up the correctness of our algorithm

-  Some Experiement I did
	
	How it normally works for non-negative sum and elements

	With negative sum, left pointer will move further beyond right pointer sometimes.

	With non-negative sum, negative elements in the array don't necessarily create a problem.

In this question, the minimum value of goal is -1. Since all our elements are non-negative, right will not satisfy the constraint in its very first move. Then left will move all the way to the end
