- [Count Number of Nice Subarrays - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays/)
- Look at how we find the maximum-length substring with at most k characters. [[340. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters]]
- One of the difference is that we need to find the subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers. We can achieve this by calculating `atMost(k) - atMost(k - 1) == exactly(k)`. 
- Another difference is that we want to find the number, instead of length in this question. Why do we do `res += right - left`?

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // find exact with at most.
        return atMost(nums, k) - atMost(nums, k - 1);
    }
    int atMost(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int res = 0;
        while(right < nums.size()) {
            k -= nums[right] % 2;
            right++;
            while(k < 0) {
                k += nums[left] % 2;
                left++;
            }
            // add the new subarrays we found
            res += right - left;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
