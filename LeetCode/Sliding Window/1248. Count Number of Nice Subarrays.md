- [Count Number of Nice Subarrays - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays/)
- Look at how we find the maximum-length substring with at most k characters. [[340. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters]]
- One of the difference is that we need to find the subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers. We can achieve this by calculating `atMost(k) - atMost(k - 1) == exactly(k)`. 
- Another difference is that
