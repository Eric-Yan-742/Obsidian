- [Count Number of Nice Subarrays - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays/)
- Look at how we find the maximum-length substring with at most k characters. [[340. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters]]
- One of the difference is that we need to find the subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers. We can achieve this by calculating `atMost(k) - atMost(k - 1) == exactly(k)`. 
- Another difference is that we want to find the number, instead of length in this question. Why do we do `res += right - left`?

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // find exact with at most.
        return atMost(nums, k) - atMost(nums, k - 1);
    }
    int atMost(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int res = 0;
        while(right < nums.size()) {
            k -= nums[right] % 2;
            right++;
            while(k < 0) {
                k += nums[left] % 2;
                left++;
            }
            // add the new subarrays we found
            res += right - left;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## Why we cannot use the minimum substring approach to directly find the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers?

```cpp
int numberOfSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
	int left = 0, right = 0;
	int res = 0;
	while(right < nums.size()) {
		k -= nums[right] % 2;
		right++;
		while(k == 0) {
			res++;
			k += nums[left] % 2;
			left++;
		}
	}
	return res;
}
```

This solution only counts the subarrays that include the two 1s from the right. `[2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1]`, `[2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1]`, `[2, 1, 2, 2, 1]`, `[1, 2, 2, 1]`. A total of 4. However, it doesn't count subarrays that include the two 1s in the middle like `[2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2]` or substrings that include the two 1s from the right like `[1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2]`

We can use this approach for minimum subarrays because we only want to find the minimum length, not number of subarrays.

On the contrary, the maximum length approach can accomplish the task of at most `k` integers because
