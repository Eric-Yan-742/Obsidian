- [Leetcode 159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.ca/all/159.html)
- Expand the window (move right pointer) when there are at most 2 unique characters in the window. Shrink the window when there are more than 2 unique characters. Update the length when the window meets the condition. 

```cpp
int solution(string s) {
    unordered_map<char, int> window;
    int res = 0;
    int left = 0, right = 0;

    while (right < s.size()) {
        char c = s[right];
        window[c]++;
        right++;
        while (window.size() > 2) {
            char d = s[left];
            window[d]--;
            // Note map doesn't remove the element automatically when value == 0.
            // We have to do it by ourselves manually.
            if (window[d] == 0) window.erase(d);
            left++;
        }
        res = max(res, right - left);
    }
    return res;
}
