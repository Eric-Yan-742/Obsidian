- We can use either 1 or 0. Let’s say we use 1, because it’s easier to keep track of number of 1s.

1. Count the number of 1s in the array. Say this number is k.
2. With a sliding window of size k, we traverse all possible subarrays of size k in the array.
3. We keep track of the number of 1s in each of the window. Get the max number of 1s in a window at the end.
4. For that max window, k (total 1s) - max, which is the number of 0s in that window, is the min number of swaps we need.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwaps(vector<int>& data) {
        int k = 0;
        for (int v : data) {
            k += v;
        }
        int t = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            t += data[i];
        }
        int mx = t;
        for (int i = k; i < data.size(); ++i) {
            t += data[i];
            t -= data[i - k];
            mx = max(mx, t);
        }
        return k - mx;
    }
};

This OA question from Tiktok 25summer Aug 17-21 is equivalent to this one.

- Note: this is different, a counter example is 011100, the solution above doesn’t work. But if we consider both 0s and 1s, why the solution still doesn’t work?
