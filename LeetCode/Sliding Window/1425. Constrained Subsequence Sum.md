- `std::multiset`: 
	- maintains the order of its elements in ascending order. 
	- Duplicates Allowed
	- Implemented by Red-Black tree, so `erase` and `insert` takes `O(logn)`. 
	- `rbegin()` returns an iterator pointing to the last element in the container, which is the largest element in multiset. It takes `O(1)`. 

- DP
	- Definition and recurrence relation are all in the picture
		- Initialization: 
- About why `ans = max(dp)`
- Why we have to take the maximum value in the dp array instead of just taking the last element in the dp? 
	- The max subsequence may not end at the last element.
- Is taking the maximum value in the dp array sufficient (covers all the subsequences)?
	- Yes, the answer has to end at some index.
