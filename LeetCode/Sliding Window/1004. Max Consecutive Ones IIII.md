[Max Consecutive Ones III - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/description/)

Think about flipping at most `k` 1s as "the window must contain at most `k` 0s". Then the question looks exactly the same as [[340. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters]]

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestOnes(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int res = 0;
        while(right < nums.size()) {
            k -= abs(nums[right] - 1);
            right++;
            while(k < 0) {
                k += abs(nums[left] - 1);
                left++;
            }
            res = max(res, right - left);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
