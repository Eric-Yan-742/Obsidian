[Word Search - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/description/)

# Approach

1. Implement a recursive function backtrack that takes the current position (i, j) in the grid and the current index k of the word.
2. Base cases: If k equals the length of the word, return True, indicating that the word has been found. If the current position (i, j) is out of the grid boundaries or the character at (i, j) does not match the character at index k of the word, return False.
3. Mark the current cell as visited by changing its value or marking it as empty (any placeholder) so that the path will not traverse backward to visit cell we've visited. 
4. Recursively explore all four directions (up, down, left, right) by calling backtrack with updated positions (i+1, j), (i-1, j), (i, j+1), and (i, j-1).
5. If any recursive call returns True, indicating that the word has been found, return True.
6. If none of the recursive calls returns True, reset the current cell to its original value for later paths to explore and return False.
7. Iterate through all cells (our path can start at any position) in the grid and call the backtrack function for each cell. If any call returns True, return True, indicating that the word exists in the grid. Otherwise, return False.
# Comparison Bug

This code snipet has problems. If  `i < 0` or `j < 0`, because `.size()` returns unsigned type, `i` and `j` will be converted to unsigned type to do the comparison. However, that will make `i` or `j` huge. As a result, even though `i` or `j` `< size()`, the statement will evaluate true. 

```cpp
if (i >= board.size() || j >= board[0].size()
    || word[k] != board[i][j]) {
    printf("(i, j): (%d, %d), board[i][j]: %c\n", i, j, board[i][j]);
    return false;
}
```

Thus, always put lower bound check in front of upper bound check for index checking of a board.

```cpp
if (i < 0 || i >= board.size() || 
	j < 0 || j >= board[0].size() ||
	word[k] != board[i][j]) {
	return false;
}
```

# Code

```cpp
class Solution {
    bool backtrack(int i, int j, int k, const string& word, vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        if(k == word.size()) {
            return true;
        }
        if (i < 0 || i >= board.size() || 
            j < 0 || j >= board[0].size() ||
            word[k] != board[i][j]) {
            return false;
        }
        char temp = board[i][j];
        board[i][j] = '\0';
        if (backtrack(i + 1, j, k + 1, word, board) ||
            backtrack(i - 1, j, k + 1, word, board) ||
            backtrack(i, j + 1, k + 1, word, board) ||
            backtrack(i, j - 1, k + 1, word, board)){
            return true;     
        }
        board[i][j] = temp;
        return false;
    }
public:
    bool exist(vector<vector<char>>& board, string word) {
        for(int i = 0; i < board.size(); i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < board[0].size(); j++) {
                if(backtrack(i, j, 0, word, board)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

# Complexity

Say `l` is the length of the word. The max level of recursions we can get is `l`. 

Recusion tree structure.
