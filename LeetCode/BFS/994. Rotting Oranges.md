[Rotting Oranges - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/description/)

## Brute Force

Use two sets to keep track of the positions of every rotted oranges and every fresh oranges. For every minute, traverse the set of rotted oranges and update the two sets. Until the set of fresh oranges is empty, we finish. 

## BFS Approach

Run a BFS starting from all rotted oranges, meaning all rotted oranges are sources. Then we expand from all of the sources. To achive it we simply add the locations of all rotted oranges into the queue at the beginning.
