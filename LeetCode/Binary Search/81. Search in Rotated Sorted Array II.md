[Search in Rotated Sorted Array II - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/description/)

Just an edge case in addition to [[33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array]]. If `nums[left] == nums[m] && nums[m] == nums[right]`. We cannot be sure which side is sorted because either side could be. As a result, we have no idea which side to choose.

In this case, the only thing we can do is to skip `nums[left]` and `nums[right]`. They cannot be target because they equal to `nums[m]` and we know `nums[m] != target`.

On the other hand, if `nums[m]` only equals to one end point, that part can only be the same number (sorted). Thus, we can proceed with the same logic. 
- Eg: `[5,5,5,3,4]` and `[6,7,5,5,5]`.
