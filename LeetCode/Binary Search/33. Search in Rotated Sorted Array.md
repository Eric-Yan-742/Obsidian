[Search in Rotated Sorted Array - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/)

[Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/solutions/14425/concise-o-log-n-binary-search-solution/)

The core part of the solution. We find the smallest element in the rotated array in $O(\log n)$ 

```cpp
while(l < r){
	m = (l + r) / 2;
	if(nums[m] > nums[r]){
		l = m + 1;
	} else { // nums[m] < nums[r]
		r = m;
	}
}
```

This is actually the same as 

```cpp
while(l <= r){
	if(l == r) break;
	m = (l + r) / 2;
	if(nums[m] > nums[r]){
		l = m + 1;
	} else { // nums[m] < nums[r]
		r = m;
	}
}
```

If `nums[m] > nums[r]`

Because the array is sorted with one rotation, it means the point of the rotation must be between `m` and `r`. 

Why does the interval always end up on one element at the end? This is a common pattern in many other bianry search problems.

The base cases of this are an interval of 2 and 3. Any other sizes of interval will be reduced to these two. 

If we take the floor of $(l + r) /2$ and updae $l$ as $l = m + 1$. $l$ and $r$ will always end up the same at the end.
