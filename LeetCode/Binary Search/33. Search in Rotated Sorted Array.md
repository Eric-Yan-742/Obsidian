[Search in Rotated Sorted Array - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/)

[Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/solutions/14425/concise-o-log-n-binary-search-solution/)

The core part of the solution. We find the smallest element in the rotated array in $O(\log n)$ 

```cpp
while(l < r){
	m = (l + r) / 2;
	if(nums[m] > nums[r]){
		l = m + 1;
	} else { // nums[m] < nums[r]
		r = m;
	}
}
```
