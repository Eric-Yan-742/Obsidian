[Find Peak Element - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description/)

There is at least one peak in the array with the constraint `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`. We need to keep at least one peak in our interval throughout the search. 

**Condition 1**: If `nums[m] > nums[m - 1]`, we take right half

Why is there at least one peak in this interval? Suppose there is no peaks in it. Then each element on the right must be greater than the previous element. However, that means the right most element must be a peak. Contradiction! 

**Condition 2**: If `nums[m - 1] > nums[m]`, we take the left half for a similar reason.

There is also an edge case. If only two elements are left in the interval, `nums[m - 1]` may be index out of bound if `l == m == 0`. Moreover, our interval may not stop moving when there is only two elements. We deal with it by just taking the larger element in the interval. 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int l = 0, r = nums.size() - 1;
        while(l < r) {
            // edge case
            if(r - l < 2) {
                return nums[r] > nums[l] ? r : l;
            }
            int m = (l + r) / 2;
            // condition 1
            if(nums[m] > nums[m - 1]) {
                l = m;
            } 
            // condition 2
            else if(nums[m - 1] > nums[m]) {
                r = m - 1;
            }
        }
        return l;
    }
};
```
