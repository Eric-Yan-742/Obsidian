[Expression Add Operators - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/expression-add-operators/description/)

In cases where operator precedence applies, how do we calculate multiplication in forward direction?

```cpp
helper(rst, path + "*" + cur, num, target, i + 1, eval - multed + multed * cur, multed * cur );
```

For example, if you have a sequence of 12345 and you have proceeded to 1 + 2 + 3, now your eval is 6 right? If you want to add a * between 3 and 4, you would take 3 as the digit to be multiplied, so you want to take it out from the existing eval. You have 1 + 2 + 3 * 4 and the eval now is (1 + 2 + 3) - 3 + (3 * 4). Hope this could help : )
